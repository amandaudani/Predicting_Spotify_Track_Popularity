📌 Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify using a machine learning model. By analyzing key features of popular Spotify songs, this model aims to provide insights into what makes a song likely to become a top-streamed track.

📊 Dataset
The dataset, Most_Streamed_Spotify_Songs_2024.csv, includes song attributes such as artist, genre, release year, and popularity score, which are analyzed to identify patterns in popular songs.

🗂 Project Structure
This project follows a structured approach to predictive modeling and includes:

Data Understanding: Initial data loading and analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, encoding, handling missing values, and normalization.
Model Training: Training models like RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, and LogisticRegression.
Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, mean absolute error, and R-squared metrics.
Model Saving: Saving the model for deployment.
🔍 Methodology
1. Data Understanding
Brief analysis and visualization of dataset structure.
2. Data Preprocessing
Encoding: Categorical to numerical conversion.
Missing Values: Handling missing data with imputation techniques.
Scaling: Standardization and normalization for better model stability.
3. Model Training
Using RandomForestRegressor with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluation with Mean Absolute Error, R-squared, and Accuracy Score (if classification).
5. Model Saving
Saved as .pkl format for future use.
